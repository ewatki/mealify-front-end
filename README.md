# Mealify (front-end)
Lindsay Wilson, Elaine Watkins, and Pha'lesa Patton Ada C19 Capstone Mealify. 

Mealify is for those who don’t know what to do with items in their pantry. They could get a recipe with items they already have and prevent food waste. This is also for young adults who don’t know what to make and want to find new, simple meals. Mealify has the ability to add food to your pantry, allergies and restrictions to your preferences, and use all this to find you personalized recipes.
